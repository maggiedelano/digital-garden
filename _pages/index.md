# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

I'm experimenting with [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), a low friction way to share my thoughts and resources.

Right now I'm actively working on a set of notes around [[My Workflows]]. I've also begun fleshing out a few other pages related to my past and current interests:

- [[Favorite Problems]]
- [[Helpful Books]]
- [[Quantified Self]]
- [[Inclusive Engineering Design]]

This digital garden is based on this [digital garden jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). The static html files are deployed using Github pages. I'm editing my markdown files using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but any text editor will do.
