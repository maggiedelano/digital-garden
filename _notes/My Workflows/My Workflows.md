title: My Workflows
---

This is the entry node to a set of notes on my workflows. The creation of these notes was inspired in part by an [episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-81-how-do-i-avoid-burnout/id1515786216?i=1000514013146) of the *Deep Questions* podcast by Cal Newport.[^1] While Cal suggests for the documents to be tool agnostic I do love my [[Tech Stack]]. I'll try and keep the high level ideas separate from some of the implementation details so anyone can try them out without relying on a specific set of tools.

[^1]: Cal specifically discusses the benefits of documenting workflows for an individual; I'm experimenting with this site both to help me and to potentially help others.
