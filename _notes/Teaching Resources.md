title: Teaching Resources
---

Here's a short list of resources for teaching, aimed at new faculty in STEM.

- [Teaching and learning STEM: a faculty guide](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Teaching+and+Learning+STEM%3A+A+Practical+Guide-p-9781118925812) (comprehensive book that is useful to read once and then refer to as a reference)
- [Summary](https://www.engr.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/drive/1Va7H5NFM9Z1XZkCjvyQ0xN87xzyxVf7j/1998-r_boice.pdf) of _The New Faculty Member_ (I haven't read the full book, but I found the summary helpful, especially about time management)
- [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzASD2VimKpUVe1D1nzgtx8ng9QmAqVq8qChIV6it4E/edit) from an Engineering workshop I attended a while back at [Bucknell](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/signature-engineering-programs/project-catalyst-how-engineer-engineering-education)
- [Teaching in no time](https://www.facultydiversity.org/webinars/16teachinginno-week1)Â from the NCFDD (requires membership, have heard good things but have not done yet)
- [Teaching with OneNote](https://blogs.swarthmore.edu/its/2020/06/23/using-onenote-for-teaching/){:target="_blank"}
