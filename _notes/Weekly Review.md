title: Weekly Review
---

This note is part of the series of notes about [[My Workflows]].

# High Level
I conduct a weekly review every Sunday night before I go to bed. The review takes anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. I picked Sunday night because I usually don't have anything else going on, and then I can hit the ground running with my Monday morning writing group. 

I focused first on building the habit of the weekly review by starting with only a few items (like emptying my personal inbox and reviewing my tasks). As I've gotten more comfortable doing the review I've added items to it. The weekly review has become a place where I schedule recurring tasks; I find that many recurring tasks are best scheduled either weekly or daily. I also sometimes skip items if I'm particularly tired or feeling a lot of resistance, but I do most items every week. If I really don't feel like doing something I explicitly mark it as optional or just remove it from my list. 

# Current Implementation

## Tasks
Here's the current list of tasks I complete for the weekly review:

- Process personal e-mail inbox
- Process work e-mail inbox (optional)
- Process [Drafts App](https://getdrafts.com/) inbox [^3]
- Tag all of my [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) links
- Process items with the `#[[Quick Capture]]` tag in [[Roam Research]]
- Clean out my computer Desktop and Downloads folders [^1] 
- Review and update my budget on [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/)
- Process [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) items imported into [[Roam Research]] (optional)
- Review and update my goals on [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/)
- Reflect on the previous week:
	- Did I accomplish my top three priorities from last week? (Yes/No)
	- Complete [Plus, Minus, Next](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) exercise
- Plan for the upcoming week:
	- Check my [[Semester Plan]] and note important upcoming deadlines
	- Clean out iOS reminders and [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) inbox
	- Complete project review on OmniFocus and choose items to focus on for the coming week
	- Choose my top three priorities for the upcoming week
	- Update daily plan [Roam42 SmartBlock](https://github.com/roamhacker/SmartBlocks) with top three priorities and upcoming deadlines [^2]
	- Assign tasks to specific days (optional) 

## Template
I have written out the tasks listed above as a set of to dos in [[Roam Research]]. I then copied and pasted the tasks into a [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) shortcut that I can trigger by typing `rmwk`.[^4] I nest each Weekly Review under the current date on the Weekly Review page so I can easily go back and look at past reviews. I also block reference the Plus, Minus, Next exercise prompts so I can see the responses to the prompts over time.

## Potential Improvements
In an ideal world I think I would spend a bit more time on the reflection questions each week. However, I have historically had a lot of resistance to answering them, and the Plus, Minus, Next is short enough that I just do it. Some future way to evaluate the right balance might be nice, like more detailed monthly or semester reviews.

# Resources
Tiago Forte has a lot of great writing about weekly reviews. Here's [one post](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-one-touch-guide-to-doing-a-weekly-review/) to get started.

# Notes
[^3]: I will talk in more detail about some of my processing/tagging workflow in [[Capture Workflow]], and possibly elaborate on other steps as well.
[^1]: This is incredibly helpful, as it forces me to either delete random screenshots and documents forever, or move them to a better location on my hard drive. I mostly follow the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) for organizing my hard drive.
[^2]: I update the block references to the priorities and deadlines in my [[Roam Research]] graph (see [[Daily Plan]]).
[^4]: Keyboard Maestro is not needed for this; templates or SmartBlocks work just as well. I just have had it set up this way since before templates were an option and I like not having to hit enter for it to trigger.
