title: Quantified Self
---

While I was in graduate school I was a co-organizer of Quantified Self Boston and started the Quantified Self Boston Women's Meetup. I have given multiple talks about my self-tracking experiences, including a [talk](https://quantifiedself.com/blog/maggie-delano-ecg-activity-tracking/){:target="_blank"} at QS13 on my experiences wearing my cardiac monitor and another [talk](https://quantifiedself.com/show-and-tell/?project=787){:target="_blank"} at QS15 about my experiences recovering from a concussion. I presented my biggest self-tracking project yet at QS18, where I shared data from [almost 5,000 pomodoros](https://quantifiedself.com/show-and-tell/?project=1112){:target="_blank"} completed over the course of my PhD. I have also been involved in diversity efforts in the Quantified Self community, including writing the first QS Code of Conduct and organizing a sponsorship program for QS15.
