title: Inclusive Engineering Design
---

Both my research and my experiences with the Quantified Self community have stimulated my interest in inclusive and anti-oppressive design. In Fall 2021 I piloted the first iteration of my [inclusive engineering design course](https://www.notion.so/ENGR-053-FA20-aab6498961fe4d3d85c9d9f31e0cdbef "ENGR 053"){:target="_blank"}, a course that is "half seminar, half design studio."  I also co-authored two [publications](/publications) on inclusive design, and have written other articles for a general audience, such as an article on the [design of period tracking apps](https://medium.com/@maggied/i-tried-tracking-my-period-and-it-was-even-worse-than-i-could-have-imagined-bb46f869f45){:target="_blank"}, and on the [perils of electronic monitoring](https://logicmag.io/justice/the-world-is-a-prison/){:target="_blank"}.
