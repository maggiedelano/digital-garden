title: Why Workflows?
---

Why share:
- see the whole picture (or at least a bigger one)
- cal said so

Why workflows:
- they do focus more on the "how" and less on the "what" and "why" - but they *can help you get to these answers*
- number one approach to live is "be process oriented and don't work too hard"
